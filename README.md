# Predictive-Model-for-Employee-Attrition

## Overview
This project develops a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving using IBM HR analytics data. The analysis applies data mining techniques to help organizations proactively manage employee retention and reduce turnover costs.

## Objectives
- Predict employee attrition using machine learning classification
- Identify key factors influencing employee turnover
- Compare performance of multiple classification algorithms
- Provide actionable insights for HR decision-making

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- **Excel**: Statistical analysis and data validation
- **Weka**: Machine learning modeling and evaluation
- **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Neural Networks, Na√Øve Bayes, Bagging, AdaBoost

## Key Findings
- **Top Models**: SVM and AdaBoostM1 (73.8% accuracy), Logistic Regression (73.5% accuracy)
- **Key Predictors**: Average years per company, total working years, job level, overtime status
- **Performance**: Logistic Regression achieved highest ROC area (0.804) and fastest training time (0.01s)
- **Business Impact**: Identified actionable factors for improving employee retention strategies
